Protocol Description	Tissues were received from NIH brain banks from postmortem individuals. Diagnoses were assigned by a pathologist. 	20mg of brain tissue was homogenized in TRIzol reagent using a BeadBug Benchtop Homogenizer. Brain tissue was suspended in 1 mL of TRIzol and homogenized for 6 rounds of 10 s homogenization and 60 s holds between each round. 300 µL of chloroform was added to the sample and aqueous separation of RNA was performed using centrifugation in a heavy gel phase-lock tube (VWR, 10847-802). The aqueous phase was applied to a standard column-based RNA purification kit (Quantabio, Extracta Plus, Cat# 95214-050) following the manufacturer’s protocol. 	Preparation of libraries for sequencing was handled by Novogene. 	RNA sequencing was performed by Novogene. Reads from samples with were processed using trim_galore (0.6.5-1) and mapped to the GRCh38.p14 genome with STAR-2.7.10a. Mapped reads were counted to genes using featureCounts (Subread-2.0.3) and the GRCh38.108 GTF file. Unwanted noise and artifacts were removed using svaseq and removeBatchEffects from the sva package-3.42.0 and differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2-1.34.0 using R-4.3.2.
